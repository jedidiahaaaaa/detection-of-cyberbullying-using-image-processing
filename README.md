# Detection of Cyberbullying using Image Processing

###### To-Do List
- [x] Test EAST detection
- [x] Test `pytesseract` after EAST detection
- [ ] Test `pytesseract` with binary image
- [x] Learn concurrency lock

- [ ] Apply concurrency on the `text-recognition.py` to process each image and points
- [ ] Apply concurrency lock on `text-recognition.py`
- [ ] Create PG-18 Word Library
- [ ] Check how hard it would be to create deep learning to learn bad words and warn
- [ ] Create search algorithm to effectively search through the library
